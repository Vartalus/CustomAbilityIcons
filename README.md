# CustomAbilityIcons
An Elder Scrolls Online addon.

## Description
This addon can do the following things:
- When a skill style is applied, it can replace the skill's normal icon found in the ability bar with the selected skill style icon.
- For scribed skills, it can select the appropriate recolor of the original icons, based on the focus script used for each skill.
- Specifically for the destruction staff skill Pulsar (Impulse morph) when using a frost staff, it can replace the base game icon with something more frosty.
